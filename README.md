# [Cycling Through The Indego Bike-Share API](https://fosscon.us/node/12742)

This is my on-going workspace to keep a copy of the presentation/slideshow that I am working on for FOSSCON!

### About

I plan to present/talk about the [Philadelphia Indego Bike-Share](https://www.rideindego.com/), its [API detailing each bicycle docking station](https://www.rideindego.com/stations/json/), and the [PHP](https://github.com/ericoc/indego-php-lib) and [Python](https://github.com/ericoc/indego-py-lib) libraries that I have created to interact with this API.

The HTML/web version is available online at [indegotalk.ericoc.com](https://indegotalk.ericoc.com/)

### FOSSCON
[FOSSCON](https://fosscon.us/) (Free & Open Source Software Conference) is [free to attend](http://fosscon.us/attend) so there is [no reason not to go](https://www.eventbee.com/v/fosscon2018#/tickets) and see [lots of other speakers](https://fosscon.us/Speakers) even if you are not interested in bicycles.
