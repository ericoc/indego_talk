# [Cycling Through The Indego Bike-Share API](https://fosscon.us/node/12742)

This is my on-going workspace to keep a copy of the presentation/slideshow that I am working on for [FOSSCON](https://fosscon.us/)!

I plan to present/talk about the [Philadelphia Indego Bike-Share](https://www.rideindego.com/), its [API detailing each bicycle docking station](https://www.rideindego.com/stations/json/), and the [PHP](https://github.com/ericoc/indego-php-lib) and [Python](https://github.com/ericoc/indego-py-lib) libraries that I have created to interact with this API.
